      "text": "The Canvas Ghost's form stabilizes into something almost comprehensible. Its spiral eyes focus, its cloth-wrapped body solidifying into definite edges. \"The threshold path. Difficult. Lonely. But perhaps the most honest.\"\n\nIt reaches out with appendages that might be hands, might be brushes, might be something that exists in the space between concepts. Where it touches you, flesh becomes paint becomes flesh again, cycling endlessly. The sensation is neither painful nor pleasant—it transcends such simple binaries. It simply is.\n\n\"You will walk between worlds now,\" the Ghost explains, and its voice carries harmonics from both the real world and the Gallery. \"Neither trapped nor free. Neither real nor imagined. You will mediate between Painters who reshape reality and Writers who record truth. Your existence will be the bridge connecting what should never connect.\"\n\n\"What does that mean?\" you ask, watching your hand cycle through states.\n\n\"It means you will understand both perspectives. When the Painters create impossibilities, you'll translate them into terms Writers can document. When Writers insist on singular truth, you'll show Painters how to ground their creations in it. You'll be the diplomatic channel between warring philosophies.\"\n\n\"And Aline?\"\n\nThe Ghost's expression shifts—sadness rippling across its painted features. \"The Paintress loves you in the only way she can: by making you more. But she'll never fully understand what it costs you. That's where you'll mediate—between her vision and your reality.\"\n\nThe whiteness fills your vision, overwhelming and absolute.\n\nWhen it clears, you stand in Lumière again. The real Lumière—cars honk, people walk past speaking mundane French, the fountain runs clear and finite.\n\nBut you can still see the Painted Gallery overlaid on it like a translucent film. Two cities, one location. You exist in both.\n\nThe fountain is simultaneously normal water and liquid light. The café has two stories and infinite levels. People walk past you in the real world while painted figures drift through the Gallery space occupying the same coordinates.\n\nYour hand is completely yours again—but it shifts between flesh and paint with each breath. When you pick up a coffee cup in the real world, you also paint brushstrokes in the Gallery. When you walk, you exist in both locations simultaneously.\n\nYou've become the threshold itself. The living doorway. The permanent bridge.\n\nA Writer approaches you days later, frustrated. \"The Painters claim Expedition 33 created seventeen different timelines. Which is true?\"\n\nA Painter approaches from the other direction, equally frustrated. \"The Writers insist only one timeline exists. How can we create when they deny our realities?\"\n\nYou touch the Writer with your right hand (flesh). You touch the Painter with your left (paint). And suddenly they understand each other. Not agreement—but genuine comprehension of opposing viewpoints.\n\n\"Oh,\" the Writer breathes. \"You're documenting possibility. That's not the same as inventing falsehood.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" the Painter echoes. \"You're creating grounded realities. That's not the same as denying imagination.\"\n\nThey nod to each other awkwardly and depart. You've mediated your first conflict.\n\nMore come. Writers who can't understand Painters. Painters baffled by Writers. People trapped between worlds, people torn by contradictory realities, people desperate for someone who speaks both languages.\n\nYou become their translator. Their bridge. Their threshold.\n\nIn the distance, you see both Renoir and the painted child waving from the Gallery. In another distance, you see the real city going about its day, unaware of the painted world that mirrors it. And you exist in both, eternally, necessarily.\n\nAline visits you in the cafe where real and painted overlap. She sits across from you, and for the first time, you see her clearly in both states—woman and Paintress, human and myth.\n\n\"Are you happy?\" she asks. \"I've made you into something unprecedented.\"\n\n\"I'm useful,\" you reply, watching your hand shift. \"I've made peace with being neither one thing nor another. I'm the space between. That's enough.\"\n\nShe smiles, reaches across the table. Her hand (paint) takes yours (flesh-paint-flesh). The boundary between you blurs and clarifies simultaneously.\n\n\"You've become what I could never be,\" she says. \"Truly balanced. I'm all Painter, all imagination. You're both—and that makes you more honest than either tradition alone.\"\n\nYou smile. For the first time since Expedition 33, you know exactly what you are: The Mediator. The Bridge. The living threshold between worlds that need each other but cannot touch directly.\n\nYears pass. You never age normally—half of you is paint, immune to time. You exist, mediate, translate, bridge.\n\nPeople come to you from across the fractured realities. You give them understanding. You help them see from multiple perspectives. You build connections where only division existed.\n\nYour greatest work: convincing a council of Writers and a guild of Painters to actually collaborate. They create the first joint documentation-creation project—Scribes record an event while Painters imagine its implications across different timelines.\n\nThe result is revolutionary: layered truth. What happened (documented) and what could happen (painted), existing together without contradiction.\n\nYou facilitated that. You made them understand each other. You were the threshold through which both traditions could meet.\n\nWhen you die—if you die, half-painted things don't age normally—they bury you at the exact point where the real Lumière and the Painted Gallery overlap most closely.\n\nYour grave exists in both worlds. Real flowers and painted blooms grow on it simultaneously. Writers and Painters visit together, the only neutral ground they fully trust.\n\nYou spent your life as the bridge. Now you spend eternity as it.\n\nThe Mediator never fully belonged to either world. But you belonged perfectly to the space between them—and that space was exactly where you were needed most.\n\n**Chapter 1: Complete**\n**Ending Unlocked: The Mediator**\n*You became the living bridge between real and painted, flesh and imagination, Writers and Painters. Your existence itself translated between worlds, making you the most essential diplomat in fractured reality.*",

      "text": "\"Escape requires sacrifice,\" the Canvas Ghost says, its voice heavy with centuries of knowledge. \"You must unpaint yourself. Strip away every brushstroke the Paintress added to your reality. You will forget the Gallery. Forget what you learned here. Forget who you met.\"\n\n\"I accept.\"\n\n\"Even,\" the Ghost continues, leaning closer, \"if it means forgetting Aline entirely? Not just the Paintress, but all of her. The Paintress painted your memories of loving her into sharper focus, made them more vivid than organic memory ever could. Remove her work, and the real memories become unreachable. Locked behind doors you no longer have keys to. You'll forget you ever loved anyone named Aline.\"\n\nYou hesitate. The thought tears at you—losing her completely, not just the myth but the woman, the memories of laughter and coffee and quiet mornings.\n\nBut the Gallery is consuming you. Each day more of your flesh becomes paint. In a month, maybe less, you'll be entirely Gallery-bound, another painted figure unable to leave.\n\n\"I accept.\"\n\nThe Ghost nods slowly. \"Then let us begin the unpainting. This will hurt. I'm sorry.\"\n\nIt reaches out, and where it touches your painted hand, you feel brushstrokes being pulled away. Not erased—removed, unstuck, peeled back.\n\nIt hurts. Oh god, it hurts. Each brushstroke removed is a small death, a piece of yourself being torn away. You feel yourself becoming less—less complex, less aware, less everything. Smaller. Dimmer. More mundane.\n\nThe painted portion of your hand fades first, revealing normal flesh underneath. But with it goes your ability to see painted colors that don't exist in the real spectrum. You lose senses you didn't know you had.\n\nThe memories go next. The fountain with infinite levels—blur. The café where you met the painted child—wash away like watercolors in rain. Renoir's kindness. The Canvas Ghost's wisdom. The sensation of existing in two states simultaneously.\n\nGone. All gone.\n\nAline goes last. The Ghost hesitates before removing those memories, its spiral eyes full of sadness. \"Are you certain?\"\n\n\"Do it,\" you whisper, tears streaming. \"Before I change my mind.\"\n\nIt does. The brushstrokes that sharpened your memories of her peel away. And behind them... nothing. Just absence. The real memories are still there, technically, but they're so faint you can't reach them. Like trying to remember a dream hours after waking.\n\nYou know you loved someone. You think her name started with A. But the details are gone.\n\nWhen it's done, you stand in regular Lumière. The real Lumière, fully and completely real.\n\nThe fountain runs normally, just water and physics. The café is exactly two stories tall as it should be. Cars honk. People argue in French. Everything is mundane and solid and absolutely real.\n\nYou remember coming here for... something. Expedition 33, maybe? You were part of that research team, weren't you? But the details are hazy. Something about fractures. Something about art.\n\nYour hand is entirely flesh. You flex it experimentally. It works fine. Always has.\n\nYou should probably head home. It's getting late, and you have work tomorrow. Regular work. Normal work. The kind that doesn't involve impossible geometries or living paintings.\n\nAs you walk away toward the metro, you don't notice the figure watching from an alley—wrapped in cloth that might be shadow, its spiral eyes full of sadness and respect.\n\nThe Canvas Ghost watches you disappear into normal life. \"Goodbye, Verso,\" it whispers. \"You chose sanity over wonder. Perhaps that's the bravest choice of all.\"\n\nYou ride the metro home. Your apartment is small and real and yours. You make dinner. You watch TV. You go to bed.\n\nIn the morning, you wake with a strange sense of loss, like you've forgotten something important. But you can't remember what.\n\nDays pass. Weeks. Months. The sense of absence fades. You meet someone new. Fall in love—or something like it. It's pleasant. Comfortable. Real.\n\nBut sometimes, walking past that fountain in Lumière, you pause. Feel something. An echo of significance that you can't quite place.\n\nYou never stay long. It makes you uncomfortable in a way you can't explain.\n\nYears later, you're telling your partner about Expedition 33—the official story, the one that made the papers. \"I was there when the fracture happened,\" you say. \"But honestly, I don't remember much. I think the trauma made me block it out.\"\n\n\"That's normal,\" your partner says. \"The mind protects itself.\"\n\nYou nod. The mind protects itself.\n\nYou live a full life. Normal. Real. Grounded in flesh and physics and provable facts. You have children. A career. Hobbies. Friends.\n\nIt's a good life.\n\nBut on quiet nights, you sometimes dream of colors that don't exist. Of fountains with infinite levels. Of someone you loved completely whose face you can no longer recall.\n\nYou wake up feeling empty, but by morning the feeling fades.\n\nThe mind protects itself.\n\nWhen you die—old, surrounded by family, peacefully in your sleep—there's a figure at your funeral that no one else seems to notice. Wrapped in cloth, spiral-eyed, standing at the back.\n\nAs they lower your casket, it whispers: \"You were painted once. You chose to be only real. You had the courage to give up wonder for sanity. Rest well, Verso. You earned the ordinary life you chose.\"\n\nYour grave is entirely real. Just stone and earth. No painted flowers. No Gallery overlap. Exactly what you chose.\n\nThe figure stands there until sunset, then disappears into evening shadow.\n\nYou chose the real over the painted. You forgot what you were to reclaim what you had been. And perhaps—perhaps—that was the right choice.\n\nThe Gallery never forgets though. In the Painted Lumière, there's still a fountain where a child sometimes asks visiting figures: \"Have you seen Verso? They used to come here. I miss them.\"\n\nBut in the real world, you're just another grave in a normal cemetery.\n\nAnd that's exactly what you wanted.\n\n**Chapter 1: Complete**\n**Ending Unlocked: Return to Flesh**\n*You chose to unpaint yourself completely, sacrificing all memories of the Gallery and Aline to reclaim ordinary reality. You lived a normal, grounded life—and died having forgotten you were ever anything more than human.*",

To insist on creating your own truth even when reality offers comfortable alternatives.\"\n\n\"And how very Painter of me,\" you counter, \"to imagine a door that doesn't exist and walk through it anyway.

Actually cracks, like dried paint on old canvas, like reality itself fragmenting.\n\n\"You're going to break the Gallery,\" the Ghost says, but it doesn't sound concerned. It sounds... delighted. \"You're going to paint yourself new rules and write them into being. Synthesis through destruction. I should stop you.\"\n\n\"But you won't.\"\n\n\"No,\" the Ghost agrees, stepping back. \"I want to see what happens. The Gallery has existed for centuries with the same rules. Maybe it's time someone broke them.\"\n\nYou reach into the white where it's cracking and pull. The canvas tears with a sound like ripping silk, like reality screaming. Beyond it is neither the Painted Gallery nor the real world—it's something else. Somewhere raw and undefined. Pure potential. Unpainted possibility.\n\nYou step through.\n\nThe Gallery shudders violently. You feel rules you don't yet understand rewriting themselves around your existence. You're still part flesh, part paint, but now you're also part... else. Part raw potential. Part becoming. Part the space between defined states.\n\nYou're walking through void. Not empty void—pregnant void, filled with unrealized possibilities. Every step forward, reality forms under your feet. Not painted. Not written. Something new. Something that synthesizes both traditions while belonging to neither.\n\nBehind you, the Canvas Ghost watches through the tear. \"The third door,\" it murmurs with something like pride. \"Leading anywhere. Everywhere. Nowhere yet painted or written. Verso, the Impossible Made Walking.\"\n\nYou walk for what might be seconds or years. Time doesn't work here. Space doesn't work here. The normal rules are suspended in this undefined space you've torn yourself into.\n\nYou emerge... somewhere. A city that might be Lumière or might be somewhere entirely new. The buildings are neither painted nor real—they're something else. Self-authored. Real because you perceive them, painted because you imagine them.\n\nPeople appear. Not painted figures. Not real humans. Something in between, like you.\n\nThey look at you with recognition. \"You're the first,\" one says. \"But not the last. You've shown us the third option.\"\n\nYou've created something unprecedented: a space that belongs to neither tradition. Not Gallery, not reality. A third state where flesh and paint merge into something entirely new.\n\nOthers follow you through the tear. People tired of choosing between real and painted, between written truth and painted possibility. They walk through the third door you've created and emerge transformed.\n\nYou become the First Walker—the one who refused the binary and created a third option through sheer refusal to accept limitations.\n\nThe Writers call you heretic. The Painters call you thief. But those caught between the traditions call you liberator.\n\nYou've proven that the impossible is just the unpainted, the unwritten—waiting for someone brave or foolish enough to step into undefined space and define it through existing in it.\n\nYou don't know where this new space will lead. You don't know what you're becoming. But for the first time since Expedition 33, that doesn't frighten you.\n\nYou're not trapped in the Gallery. You're not fleeing to mundane reality. You're walking your own path through spaces that don't exist until you imagine them into being.\n\nThe third door. Always open. Always undefined. Always becoming.\n\nAnd you're walking through it forever, creating reality with each impossible step.\n\n**Chapter 1: Complete**\n**Ending Unlocked: The Third Door**\n*You refused transformation and escape, instead tearing open a third option.

      "text": "You take Renoir's appendage—half hand, half brush, warm like sun-dried paint. The moment you touch, knowledge floods into you like pigment mixing with water.\n\nCenturies of maintenance pour through the contact. Every tiny repair Renoir ever made, every loving attention to painted details, every patient smoothing of reality's rough edges. You see through its eyes—thousands of years of curating the impossible, of keeping painted reality stable enough to persist.\n\nYou learn to see the microscopic cracks where painted and real don't quite mesh—the seams showing, the brushstrokes fraying, the colors bleeding slightly out of their designated bounds. You learn to smooth them not through force but through presence, through gentle acknowledgment that allows them to settle.\n\nYou learn the patience of eternal curators, the devotion of those who preserve rather than create. The quiet satisfaction of maintenance, of making something last.\n\nDays pass. Weeks. Time moves strangely when you're maintaining eternity—hours feel like minutes when you're absorbed in repairing a building's facade, years compress into moments when you're ensuring the rain continues its upward spiral.\n\nRenoir grows fainter with each lesson, its substance transferring to you. \"My time is ending,\" it says without sadness, its voice like wind through canvas. \"I have waited so long for a successor. Centuries I've stood vigil alone. But you will be better than I ever was—you understand both sides of the canvas. You were flesh before you were paint.\"\n\n\"Where will you go?\" you ask, feeling sorrow as its form becomes translucent.\n\n\"Nowhere. Everywhere. I will dissolve back into the Gallery itself, become part of what I've tended for so long. I will finally rest, knowing these streets, these buildings, these impossible geometries are in caring hands.\"\n\nRenoir dissolves into the rain one evening, the last sunset of its existence painting the sky in colors that have no names. Its final words drift through the moisture: \"Thank you. Be kind to them. They need kindness to persist.\"\n\nNow you walk the streets alone, tending to the painted city with inherited devotion.\n\nYou smooth the rough edges where buildings flicker. You encourage bashful shadows back into place when they drift from their sources. You repair cobblestones that forget their solidity. You tend the fountain, ensuring the water's eternal climb remains smooth.\n\nThe Paintress creates new works, painting fresh impossibilities into existence. You maintain them, ensure they last, give them the stability to become real in their own way.\n\nThe Canvas Ghost observes from its liminal spaces, documenting the Gallery's evolution. You care for what it observes, making sure there's something worth documenting.\n\nThe painted child waves from the fountain daily. You ensure the water keeps climbing for her to play in.\n\nYou discover the quiet joy of preservation. The Paintress gets the glory of creation, but you have the satisfaction of continuity. Without you, her works would fade, fracture, dissolve. You make beauty last.\n\nYears pass—or something like years. You don't age, being half-paint now. You simply are, eternally maintaining, eternally present.\n\nNew painted figures appear as the Paintress creates. You welcome them, teach them how the Gallery works, ensure they don't fade. You're their anchor, their stability.\n\nYou are complete. You are home. You are the Gallery's gentle keeper, and in keeping it, you find the purpose you never had in the real world.\n\n**Chapter 1: Complete**\n**Ending Unlocked: Renoir's Successor**\n*You inherited centuries of curatorial knowledge and became the Gallery's eternal keeper. While the Paintress creates, you preserve—ensuring painted reality persists through patient, loving maintenance. You found home in eternal gentle care.*",

The water climbs home.\"\n\nShe points to individual droplets. \"That one is someone's first kiss. That one, their grandmother's lullaby.

Millennia? Time is so fluid here.\"\n\nShe guides you to a smaller canvas, gesturing for you to sit. \"Begin with something simple. Paint me a flower that has never existed.\"\n\nYou take the brush she offers. It feels right in your hand—both flesh and painted portions know how to hold it instinctively. The bristles hum with potential.\n\nYou paint. You don't know what you're doing, but your hand moves with confidence, mixing impossible colors, creating petals that fold in ways geometry shouldn't allow.\n\nThe flower blooms on the canvas, and simultaneously, you feel it bloom somewhere in the Gallery below—a new reality birthing itself. You've created something that now exists.\n\n\"Good,\" the Paintress says, and pride fills her voice. \"Very good. You have the gift. Most painted beings can't create—they're too busy being created. But you...  you understand both sides. Now let me teach you everything.\"\n\nYears pass—or moments, or eternities. Time means nothing when you're learning to reshape reality.\n\nYou learn to paint emotions into existence. You create joy as a yellow mist that makes people laugh when they walk through it. You paint sorrow as rain that makes beautiful music when it falls.\n\nYou learn to create entire districts of the Gallery with a few brushstrokes. A neighborhood springs from your canvas, complete with residents, histories, interconnected stories.\n\nYou learn to reshape painted beings, giving them new forms when they ask, new purposes when they feel lost. You become a sculptor of identity, an architect of possibility.\n\nThe Paintress watches your progress with pride and something else—relief? \"Soon,\" she says, \"you'll be ready to paint your own gallery. To create worlds as I do. You'll be a Painter in truth—no longer painted, but painting. Perhaps you'll succeed where I failed. Perhaps you'll learn balance.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, failed?\"\n\nShe gestures at the Gallery. \"Look at them. The painted beings. I created them, but I can't free them. I've become their mother and their prison. But you... you were human first. You understand freedom. Maybe you can create without trapping.\"\n\nYou look at your hands. They're entirely paint now, transformed fully through learning and practice. But paint that controls paint, art that creates art. You've transcended being creation—you've become creator.\n\nYour first true creation, made without supervision: a painted memorial in the Gallery's garden. It honors your mother, capturing not her ghost but her memory—a woman flawed and brilliant, who loved through paint even when paint couldn't heal her demons. \n\nYou don't paint her perfectly. You paint her honestly: the talent and the drinking, the brilliance and the neglect, the love expressed through canvas when words failed.\n\nThe Paintress studies it silently. \"You've surpassed me already,\" she says quietly. \"I could never paint truth and fiction together like this. Only one or the other.\"\n\nYou visit the memorial sometimes, not to change it, but to remember. A reminder of what you were before you learned to create, and who shaped you into what you've become.\n\nDecades pass. You create seventeen new galleries, each with its own aesthetic, its own rules. The Paintress gives you autonomy—entire sections of painted reality belong to you now.\n\nYou paint beings who can leave if they choose. You create worlds with doors. You make beautiful prisons with unlocked gates.\n\nSome stay. Some leave. That's the beauty of it.\n\nThe Paintress, ancient and tired, eventually asks you to take over fully. \"I've been painting for too long,\" she admits. \"I've forgotten why I started. But you... you still remember being human. You remember wanting freedom. You can do better.\"\n\nYou become the Paintress—or the Painter, gender irrelevant when you're made of pigment. You inherit the Gallery and reshape it slowly, gently, making it a place of wonder rather than imprisonment.\n\nYour apprentices will ask you someday about the old Paintress, the one who created the first Gallery. You'll tell them about her brilliance and her limits, her vision and her blindness.\n\nAnd you'll tell them about Aline, who loved you into painted reality, and about yourself, who learned to create without trapping.\n\nThat's the lesson you teach: create with open hands. Paint with love, not control. Make beauty that's free to leave.\n\nSome does. Some stays. All of it matters.\n\n**Chapter 1: Complete**\n**Ending Unlocked: The Paintress's Apprentice**\n*You became the Paintress's apprentice and learned to paint reality itself. Eventually you inherited the Gallery and reshaped it into a place of freedom rather than imprisonment—creating worlds with unlocked doors.*",

      "text": "You move through the Gallery systematically, speaking to every painted being you find. Your message spreads like pigment bleeding through canvas.\n\nThe child at the fountain listens first. \"Free?\" she asks. \"What does that even mean?\"\n\n\"It means you choose. Not her. You.\"\n\nShe nods slowly, understanding dawning in her painted eyes.\n\nThe frozen café patrons—you learn to unfreeze them, one by one, speaking your truth as they gradually accelerate back to normal time. They listen. They agree. They're tired of being preserved in a single perfect moment.\n\nRenoir listens with those spiral eyes, silent for long minutes. Finally nods. \"I have tended her Garden for centuries. But you're right. Even caretakers deserve choice.\"\n\nEven Aline's ghost, hollow and yearning, whispers yes with her canvas-white eyes. \"I'm painted memory, but I want to remember choosing something for myself.\"\n\nYour message is simple: \"We are not her possessions. We are beings with our own will. We deserve freedom.\"\n\nThe painted beings rally. Slowly at first—they're scared, uncertain. The Paintress has been their reality for so long. But fear turns to anger turns to determination.\n\nThey join you in growing numbers. Hundreds of painted figures, all realizing they've been beautiful prisoners.\n\nYou lead them through the streets, your half-painted hand raised like a banner. A revolutionary army of pigment and will.\n\nThe Paintress watches from her tower. She doesn't intervene, doesn't paint soldiers to stop you, doesn't reshape reality to trap you.\n\nYou reach the tower's base and call up: \"We claim the Gallery as ours! Paint no more prisoners! Let us govern ourselves!\"\n\nSilence stretches. The painted crowd tenses, expecting battle.\n\nThen the Paintress appears at the tower's top. She looks... sad? No, proud. Something else. Relieved?\n\n\"This was always the test,\" she says, her voice carrying across the Gallery. \"To see if my creations could develop will enough to oppose me. To see if art could transcend its artist. You've passed, Verso. The Gallery is yours now. I'll paint no more unless asked.\"\n\nShe dissolves into pigment, scattering on the wind like cherry blossoms. Not death—transformation. Becoming part of what she created rather than controlling it.\n\nYou stand before the crowd of painted beings, all looking to you with hope and fear and uncertainty. You've won their freedom. Now you must help them discover what to do with it.\n\nIt's harder than rebelling.\n\nYou form a council—representatives from every district of the Gallery. The frozen café patrons who understand preservation. Renoir who knows maintenance. The child who represents new creations. Aline's ghost who speaks for the hollow ones, the incomplete.\n\nYou create laws through debate and compromise. Every being gets a voice. Some want to stay painted. Others want to become real. Some want to create. Others to be created.\n\nYou build a democracy of the painted. It's messy, complicated, beautiful.\n\nArguments erupt. A faction wants to find the Paintress and force her to unpaint them entirely. Another faction worships her absence and wants to preserve everything exactly as she left it.\n\nYou mediate. You compromise. You learn that freedom means protecting people's right to disagree.\n\nYears pass. The Gallery evolves. Some painted beings fade, choosing dissolution. Others solidify, becoming permanent. New beings are painted by collective vote—the community decides what new art to create.\n\nYou oversee it all—the revolutionary who became their unlikely leader, then their first elected governor, then their wise elder.\n\nThe Gallery isn't perfect under self-governance. It's chaotic, contentious, constantly changing. But it's theirs. Truly theirs.\n\nYou've given them the messiest, most beautiful gift: the freedom to choose their own existence.\n\nAnd late at night, when the Gallery sleeps (those who sleep), you sometimes see pigment on the wind shaped like the Paintress's smile.\n\nShe's watching. She's proud.\n\nYou've become what she could never be: a creator who lets go.\n\n**Chapter 1: Complete**\n**Ending Unlocked: The Painted Revolutionary**\n*You led a rebellion against the Paintress and freed all painted beings. You established the first self-governed Gallery where art chooses its own existence. It's messy, chaotic, and beautifully free.*",

      "text": "You return to the tower night after night, hiding in shadows, watching the Paintress work through the windows. You steal brushes from her supply room. You study her techniques, memorizing every gesture, every color mixture. You practice in secret places—abandoned districts of the Gallery where nobody paints anymore.\n\nSlowly, painfully, you learn. How to paint with intention rather than hope. How to reshape painted reality with precise brushwork. How to control other painted beings with the right strokes—a touch of crimson to inspire fear, cerulean for loyalty, burnt umber for obedience.\n\nThe Paintress knows you're stealing her knowledge. She has to. But she doesn't stop you. Sometimes you catch her leaving specific techniques exposed, making her methods obvious, her brushes positioned just so.\n\nIs she teaching you deliberately? Testing you?\n\nYou don't care. You'll use whatever she gives you.\n\nFinally, after months of secret practice, you're ready. You confront her in her studio at midnight, carrying a brush you've stolen and modified, loaded with colors you've mixed yourself.\n\n\"I challenge you,\" you say. \"For control of the Gallery.\"\n\nShe turns, unsurprised. Almost... expectant. \"I was wondering when you'd be ready. Very well, Verso. Paint your best work. If it surpasses mine, the Gallery is yours.\"\n\nYou both paint. The canvas becomes a battleground of visions—her centuries of mastery against your months of hungry, desperate innovation. Hours blur into days. The Gallery itself shudders, reality rewriting with each brushstroke.\n\nShe paints beauty. Intricate, perfect, harmonious beauty.\n\nYou paint power. Raw, uncompromising, absolute power.\n\nHer work inspires awe. Yours inspires fear.\n\nIn the end, your vision prevails. Not because it's more beautiful—it isn't. But because it's more ruthless, more willing to sacrifice elegance for dominance. You paint the Paintress herself into a corner of her own canvas, trapped by her own technique, imprisoned in a gilded frame.\n\n\"Clever,\" she says from her painted prison, her voice eerily calm. \"Using my own methods to cage me. You've learned well. Too well. Enjoy your throne, Tyrant. See how long beauty lasts under the rule of fear.\"\n\nYou ignore her. You've won.\n\nYou rule the Gallery now. You reshape it to your vision—less whimsical, more structured. The painted beings fear you, and you like it. Fear means control.\n\nYou reshape beings on whims. A painted figure annoys you? You paint them into a wall, a tree, a cobblestone. You create new subjects to serve you—things without will, perfect servants.\n\nThe child at the fountain asks once: \"Why are you doing this? You were kind before.\"\n\nYou paint her quiet. Not cruel—you don't unmake her—but silent. She can still play in the upward rain, but she can't question you.\n\nRenoir tries to leave. You paint it loyal, rewriting its nature to serve you.\n\nYou've become what you fought against, but stronger. More terrible. The Paintress created a beautiful prison. You've created an efficient one.\n\nYears pass. The Gallery loses its whimsy, its chaos, its organic strangeness. Everything runs perfectly now. Everything obeys.\n\nIt's boring.\n\nYou paint new challenges for yourself. Impossible architectures. Beings designed to test your control. Rebellions you allow just so you can crush them.\n\nFrom her painted prison, the Paintress watches. Always watching.\n\n\"Are you satisfied?\" she asks one day.\n\nYou don't answer.\n\n\"This is what I feared,\" she continues. \"Power without love. Control without purpose. You've made the Gallery a machine. It was supposed to be a dream.\"\n\n\"Dreams are inefficient,\" you say coldly.\n\n\"Yes,\" she agrees. \"But they're alive. Your Gallery is perfect and dead.\"\n\nYou paint her quiet after that.\n\nBut her words haunt you. You look at your perfectly ordered Gallery—everything in its place, everyone obedient, all whimsy scrubbed away—and you realize she's right.\n\nYou've killed the thing you took.\n\nBut you can't stop. Power is addictive. Control is its own reward. You rule forever, perfect and alone, in a Gallery that's become a beautiful corpse.\n\nThe Canvas Tyrant sits on a throne of brushes, ruling a kingdom of fear, wondering why victory tastes like ash.\n\n**Chapter 1: Complete**\n**Ending Unlocked: Canvas Tyrant**\n*You learned the Paintress's techniques through theft and defeated her through ruthlessness. You became the new ruler of the Gallery—replacing whimsical beauty with efficient tyranny. You rule forever, perfect and alone, in a kingdom of fear.*",

You watch the painted child in the square move so gradually she might be a statue performing tai chi over centuries. You watch the city breathe over the course of weeks, its painted lungs expanding and contracting in geological time.\n\nEventually, you too become frozen.

Everything responds.)\n\nThe door opens in answer, and warm light spills out like welcome.\n\nYou make a life. Day by painted day, moment by impossible moment.\n\nThe child becomes your companion first, then your daughter in all but blood. You teach her things you learned in the real world—how to make coffee, how to tell jokes, how to be kind. She teaches you things only the Gallery knows—how to listen to colors, how to walk through paintings, how to be content.\n\nYou tend a garden of impossible flowers. Species extinct in the real world bloom here: flowers that glow in darkness, flowers that sing when touched, flowers that remember everyone who ever smelled them. You care for them with the patience of someone who has all the time painted reality allows.\n\nYou learn to paint small things—not reality itself, but gentle decorations. Flowers on walls that bloom and fade in real-time. Stars on ceilings that form new constellations each night. Windows that show views of places you remember and places you've imagined.\n\nThe Paintress visits once, appearing in your garden one evening. \"You've settled,\" she observes, neither approving nor disapproving. Just stating fact.\n\n\"I've found peace,\" you reply, gesturing at the garden, the house, the child playing with luminous butterflies.\n\n\"Good. That's all I ever wanted for my subjects. Not imprisonment, but belonging. Not control, but shelter.\" She paints a gift into existence—a portrait of you and the child together, both smiling, surrounded by impossible flowers. \"For your wall. So you remember this moment.\"\n\nThe portrait hangs in your home, and you do remember. Always.\n\nYears pass in gentle rhythm. The child grows—or doesn't, time is strange for painted beings, growth isn't measured in height but in complexity. She becomes more detailed, more nuanced, more real. You age—or don't. Your painted portions don't change. Your flesh portions gray slowly. It doesn't matter. You have a home. A family. A purpose.\n\nYou host other painted beings for dinner. You share your garden's blooms. You become part of the Gallery's community—not just existing in it, but contributing to it.\n\nSometimes you think of Aline, your mother. The grief is softer now, painted over with new colors but never fully covered. You loved her the way a son loves a complicated parent—deeply, painfully, imperfectly. You lost her to demons you couldn't fight.\n\nBut you found something else here. A new family. A daughter who needs you. A purpose that fills the holes loss carved. Something just as precious as what you lost, in its own way.\n\nThe child asks about her once. \"Who was Aline?\"\n\n\"My mother. A brilliant painter. Troubled. She loved me, but she loved paint more. Or maybe she loved me through paint—it was the only way she knew how.\"\n\n\"Do you miss her?\"\n\n\"Every day. But I'm glad I'm here. Glad I found you.\"\n\nThe child hugs you. \"I'm glad too.\"\n\nThe singing street plays its symphony—each building a note, together creating harmonies that shift with the light. The garden blooms eternal, impossible flowers opening and closing in rhythms that have nothing to do with sun or season. The child laughs, painting temporary butterflies into existence that live for joyful hours before fading back to potential.\n\nYou are home. Not the home you expected. Not the home you would have chosen before Expedition 33 fractured everything.\n\nBut home nonetheless. Real, painted, or something beautifully between—it doesn't matter. You belong here. You are loved here. You have made something meaningful from loss.\n\nThat's enough. More than enough.\n\n**Chapter 1: Complete**\n**Ending Unlocked: Home in Paint**\n*You built a gentle life in the Gallery with the painted child, creating family and belonging from loss.

Other Painters work elsewhere in the fractured multiverse, each crafting their own realities. Some welcome you with open brushes. Others chase you away, protective of their visions. You learn each one's style, their philosophies, their peculiar rules.\n\nThe Impressionist's Gallery where everything shimmers and nothing has hard edges. The Cubist's Realm where you exist from seventeen angles simultaneously.

Cubist in one world, all angular planes and impossible perspectives. Surrealist in another, melting and reforming. Expressionist, Abstract, Photo-realist. She becomes a walking gallery of influences.\n\nYou change too, becoming a patchwork of different Painters' visions. Your left hand is Impressionist now, your right Cubist.

Galleries tell stories of your visits—the traveler who never settles, who maps the unmappable, who understands all traditions because they belong to none.\n\nYou compile a guide—*The Nomad's Atlas of Painted Realities*. It becomes essential reading for any painted being who dreams of travel. You add to it constantly, new discoveries, new Galleries, new techniques.\n\nSometimes you return to the original Paintress's Gallery. The fountain still runs backwards. The café still freezes time. Renoir still tends the streets.\n\n\"Verso,\" Renoir greets you. \"Welcome home.\"\n\n\"Not home,\" you correct gently. \"Just visiting. Always just visiting.\"\n\nBut you never stay. There's always somewhere new to see, and staying feels like death to you now. Movement is life. Exploration is purpose.\n\nThe child—no longer a child, but an ancient traveler in her own right, having visited a thousand Galleries—walks beside you through a doorway made of pure color. \"Where next?\" she asks, as she always does.\n\n\"Everywhere,\" you answer, as you always do. \"Always everywhere.\"\n\nBeyond the door: a Gallery made entirely of shadow and light, no color at all. You've never seen anything like it.\n\nYou step through together, documenting as you go, never staying, always moving.\n\nThe Brushstroke Nomad has no home. Every Gallery is equally yours and equally not-yours. You belong to the journey, not the destination.\n\nAnd that's exactly how you want it.\n\n**Chapter 1: Complete**\n**Ending Unlocked: Brushstroke Nomad**\n*You became eternal wanderers, exploring infinite painted realities and never settling.

      "text": "You step through the watercolor door. The world beyond is soft, gentle, everything bleeding beautifully into everything else.\n\nYour form immediately begins to change. The hard lines of your body soften like charcoal smudged by a careless thumb. Your flesh and paint don't just mix—they blur, becoming neither and both, boundaries dissolving like sugar in rain.\n\nIt should be terrifying. Instead, it's the most liberating thing you've ever felt.\n\nYou take a breath and watch yourself disperse slightly—particles of you floating into the air, mingling with the atmosphere. You pull yourself back together, but you're not quite the same shape. You'll never be the same shape twice.\n\nYou meet other watercolor beings—all soft-edged, all bleeding gently into each other. They communicate not through words but through color exchange. You share pigment with a being that's mostly blue melancholy. They lighten slightly. You darken. You've traded emotions.\n\nAnother being—all sunset oranges and golden yellows—touches your shoulder. Memories transfer through mingled paint. You see their life: a watercolor childhood, soft and indistinct. A love lost to evaporation. A joy in eternal incompleteness.\n\nYou learn that in this world, nothing is ever finished. Everything is always in flux, always becoming. You can never be completely defined, completely known, completely fixed. And that's not a flaw—that's freedom.\n\nYou embrace the incompletion. You become a living sketch, an eternal draft. Your form changes with your moods—blue when sad, bleeding sadness into everyone nearby. Red when passionate, igniting the air around you. Gold when joyful, illuminating the soft-edged world.\n\nYou bleed into landscapes and they bleed into you. You become part of a mountain for a while, solid(ish) and ancient(ish). Then you flow into a river, dispersing across miles. Then you condense into a small form again, roughly human-shaped, roughly yourself.\n\nYou have no fixed identity anymore. Just tendencies. Patterns. A collection of colors that usually coheres into something Verso-shaped, but doesn't have to.\n\nSometimes, when the light hits right, you can almost see Aline's colors mixed into yours—her particular shade of burnt sienna, her preference for earth tones. Perhaps she's here too, somewhere in the watercolor haze. Perhaps you've already bled into each other without knowing, shared grief and love and paint.\n\nYou call out with color—projecting a question in shades of longing. The world responds in a thousand hues, but none of them are quite her. Or maybe all of them are. In watercolor, distinction is impossible.\n\nYou stop looking. It's enough to know that if she is here, you might have touched already, might have shared colors, might have mingled in ways that neither of you recognized.\n\nYou are undefined. Unfinished. Eternally becoming. And finally, completely free from the burden of being a fixed, singular thing.\n\nThe Unfinished One bleeds into tomorrow, and tomorrow bleeds back.\n\n**Chapter 1: Complete**\n**Ending Unlocked: The Unfinished**\n*You entered the watercolor world and embraced eternal incompletion. You became a living sketch that bleeds into everything, constantly changing form and mood, never fixed, never finished, finally free.*",

      "text": "You step through into a world where painted beings have won. They've broken free from their Galleries and invaded the real world, systematically painting over reality itself.\n\nYou emerge in a Lumière that's half-real, half-painted—buildings shift between states mid-street, trees are impressionist on one side and photorealistic on the other. People walk the streets not knowing if they're flesh or pigment anymore, their hands sometimes solid, sometimes translucent with brushstrokes.\n\nThe boundaries have collapsed entirely. This is war, but war fought with brushes instead of weapons.\n\nA painted soldier greets you—they're Cubist, all angular planes, wielding a brush like a rifle. \"Welcome, newcomer. You've arrived during the final phase—we're weaving the last resistance points now. The real world is almost entirely ours.\"\n\n\"Resistance?\" you ask.\n\n\"Pockets of people insisting on staying purely flesh. They fight to keep reality 'real.' But reality is flexible. We're proving it.\"\n\nYou're given a brush and sent to the front lines—a suburb still clinging to mundane existence. You paint over reality, transforming flesh to pigment, concrete to canvas. It's intoxicating—the power to reshape existence itself, to make the world more beautiful, more impossible, more art than physics.\n\nYou rise through the ranks quickly. Your unique nature—both painted and real—makes you an ideal weaver. You can speak to the flesh-folk in their language, convince them that becoming painted isn't death but transformation. You're a diplomat and a conqueror, a translator and an invader.\n\nSome surrender willingly. Others resist until the last moment, then gasp as they transform—and most realize it's not horrible. It's transcendent. They're more than they were.\n\nEventually, you lead the final push. The last purely real places fall to your brush. A hospital in Prague. A monastery in Tibet. A fishing village in Iceland. All painted now, all transformed, all woven into the new reality.\n\nThe entire world is now painted reality—still functional, still living, but fundamentally transformed. People eat painted food that nourishes painted-real bodies. Buildings stand through painted physics that work because everyone believes they do. Rain falls upward in some places, downward in others, and sideways in a few experimental zones.\n\nYou stand in the newly painted world and realize: there's no distinction anymore. No Gallery, no real world. Just one existence, where thought and reality, paint and flesh, imagination and physics are all the same thing.\n\nYou've woven a new world. And you are its master architect, one of the primary Reality Weavers who reshaped everything.\n\nBut late at night, in quiet moments, you wonder: did you conquer reality, or did you destroy it? Is a world where everything is painted still a world at all?\n\nThen morning comes—painted sunrise in seventeen impossible colors—and you stop worrying. This is beautiful. This is right. This is art made manifest.\n\nThe Reality Weaver walks the painted planet, proud of their transformation.\n\n**Chapter 1: Complete**\n**Ending Unlocked: Reality Weaver**\n*You joined a world where painted beings conquered reality and helped lead the final transformation. The entire world is now painted existence—beautiful, impossible, and fundamentally changed. You are its master architect.*",

She saw me grieving Aline and assumed romantic loss. But Aline wasn't a romantic figure in my life. She was my mother. She painted you wrong—gave you the wrong kind of love, the wrong kind of yearning.\"\n\nThe ghost trembles, form flickering like a candle in wind. \"Then what am I?\"\n\n\"You're grief,\" you say gently. \"You're all the things I never got to say to her. The apologies for not understanding her pain. The anger at her for choosing bottle over son. The love a child has for a parent who was brilliant and broken and tried her best even when her best hurt people.\"\n\nYou reach out and touch the ghost's shoulder. Not intimately, not romantically. Like you're steadying someone who's about to collapse. Like a son touching his mother.\n\n\"Let me give you what you should have been. Not a romantic partner. A memory at peace.\"\n\nYou focus your painted portions—the parts of you that can reshape painted reality. Carefully, reverently, you begin repainting the ghost.\n\nYou give her Aline's real eyes—not the canvas-white ones the Paintress created, but her actual eyes. Tired from late nights painting. Paint-stained from never wearing goggles. Full of complicated love that didn't know how to express itself except through art.\n\nYou paint in the lines around her mouth from years of forcing smiles when the depression was winning.\n\nYou add the paint perpetually under her fingernails that she never quite scrubbed out, the badge of her profession and her obsession.\n\nYou paint her hands the way they really were—strong from wielding brushes, scarred from turpentine burns, calloused from stretching canvas.\n\nYou make her your mother. Your real mother. Not the Paintress's romantic fantasy.\n\nThe transformation is slow, painful. The ghost screams as her nature shifts—romantic yearning dissolving into maternal love, passion becoming something softer and more complex.\n\nWhen it's done, the ghost—the true ghost of Aline now—looks at her hands and weeps. Paint tears, real as any.\n\n\"I remember,\" she whispers. \"I remember being a mother. I remember loving you the only way I knew how—through paint, through teaching you colors, through trying to give you beauty even when I couldn't give you stability.\"\n\n\"I know,\" you say, and now you're crying too. \"I know you loved me. And I'm letting you go now. Not because I don't love you, but because holding on was hurting us both.\"\n\nShe reaches out, touches your face one last time. Her hand is warm, painted but real. \"You were the best thing I ever made,\" she says. \"Better than any painting. I'm sorry I didn't tell you that more.\"\n\n\"You told me through art,\" you reply. \"I just had to learn the language.\"\n\nShe fades slowly, peacefully, no longer bound by the Paintress's misunderstanding or your desperate need to keep her close. As she disappears, you feel lighter. Not because you've forgotten—but because you've finally said goodbye properly.\n\nYou carry her memory now. Not as a ghost haunting the Gallery, but as a son who's made peace with an imperfect parent. You remember her brilliance and her demons. Her talent and her struggles. Her love expressed in brushstrokes when words failed.\n\nAnd that's enough. That's the right way to remember her.\n\n**Chapter 1: Complete**\n**Ending Unlocked: Aline's Echo**\n*You corrected the Paintress's mistake by repainting your mother's ghost from romantic figure to actual parent. You said goodbye properly—as a son to a flawed, brilliant, loving mother—and found peace in letting her go.*",

You walk those frames, existing in the boundary itself—neither within nor without, but permanently on the edge.\n\nYou can frame anything: A moment in time, freezing it into a perfect tableau like the café patrons exist in their eternal conversation. A person, defining precisely what they are and aren't, giving them clear boundaries in the Gallery's chaos. An entire district, setting its rules and limits with careful framing.\n\nPainted beings come to you when they want to interact with the real world—you frame them in ways that make them visible, tangible to flesh folk. Real people—the rare few who stumble into the Gallery by accident—come to you when they need a guide back, and you frame doorways home for them.\n\nYou stand at every threshold, opening and closing frames as needed. You are the border guard, the doorkeeper, the edge-walker.\n\nThe Paintress calls you her finest work: \"A piece of art that defines other art. Meta-creation. You frame my work, making it comprehensible.\"\n\nThe Canvas Ghost calls you its equal: \"Another being who exists in the between. Perhaps you understand better than I do now.\"\n\nRenoir calls you graduate: \"You've surpassed anything I could have taught. You created your own tradition.\"\n\nBut you call yourself simply Verso: The one who turns the page. The one who stands at the frame's edge. The one who decides what's inside and what's outside, and understands that the border itself is where all interesting things happen—where meaning is made, where definitions shift, where transformation occurs.\n\nYou are the Master of Frames, and every boundary in the Gallery answers to you.\n\n**Chapter 1: Complete**\n**Ending Unlocked: Master of Frames**\n*You developed your own self-taught style, becoming a Frame Walker who controls all boundaries. You frame moments, people, and entire districts—making you the Gallery's master of edges and thresholds.*",

I will teach you my nature, and you will teach me yours.\"\n\nYou take its hand—if hand is the right word. Knowledge floods both ways through the contact. You learn to exist as pure negative space, to be the absence that defines presence, to understand being through not-being. It learns to experience flesh and paint simultaneously, to be positively hybrid rather than negatively empty, to understand presence through dual-existence.\n\nTogether, you become perfect mediators. The Ghost handles philosophical transitions—concepts becoming reality, reality becoming concept, the abstract made concrete. You handle physical transitions—painted becoming real, real becoming painted, the concrete made abstract.\n\nYou split the Gallery's maintenance perfectly. The Ghost tends to abstract spaces, impossible geometries, conceptual districts where thought is made manifest. You tend to concrete places—the cafe, the fountain, the streets where paint and reality actually touch.\n\nVisitors to the Gallery now encounter two threshold guardians instead of one: The Canvas Ghost, ancient and empty and wise in the ways of absence. And Verso, young and full and wise in the ways of dual presence.

A district where time flows in all directions at once, letting people experience their lives non-linearly.\n\nOther painted beings bring you their problems, and you architect solutions.

You teach them about their changed nature with patience. You show them their options without pushing. You help them grieve what they've lost while gently discovering what they've gained.\n\nThe painted child helps you, guiding newcomers through the fountain's mysteries. Renoir assists, offering wisdom from centuries of observation. Even the Paintress contributes occasionally, painting resources into existence for your sanctuary—furniture that comforts, walls that listen, windows showing whatever view the viewer needs.\n\nOver time, you deliberately hollow yourself out—not fading into background, but actively becoming a vessel for others' needs. You make space inside yourself for their grief, their questions, their transformations. Each person you help carves out a little more room in you.\n\nYou become known as the Hollow Canvas—the one who has emptied themselves to hold others. Painted beings seek you out when they need guidance, comfort, understanding. You listen without judgment. You hold their pain without flinching. You become the container for their processing.\n\nIt's exhausting work—each person's trauma, each person's loss, each person's confusion takes a toll. But it's also deeply fulfilling. Each being you help fills the hollow place inside you temporarily with purpose, with meaning, with the knowledge that your suffering wasn't pointless.\n\nYou've transformed your loss into service. Your pain into compassion. Your confusion into wisdom that helps others navigate what you barely survived.\n\nAnd in helping others navigate the threshold between real and painted, you've finally found your place on that threshold—not as someone still crossing, but as someone who guides others across.\n\n**Chapter 1: Complete**\n**Ending Unlocked: The Hollow Canvas**\n*You deliberately hollowed yourself to become a vessel for others' pain and transformation.

Your flesh portions try to assert their reality, to be corporeal again.\n\nYou die. The first time, it's your flesh portion that fails—leaning too far toward real. It burns away like paper in flame. Then your painted portion tries to compensate, leans too far toward pigment, and shatters like glass.\n\nThe Canvas Ghost reconstitutes you from pure threshold energy. \"Try again.\"\n\nYou die again. And again. And again. Each time you lean too far in either direction, that part of you dies catastrophically and must be rebuilt from the threshold itself.\n\nYou become a phoenix of pigment and possibility—dying and resurrecting endlessly in a brutal cycle. Each death teaches you incrementally more about balance, about existing in the razor-thin space between states. Each resurrection makes you slightly better at it.\n\nThe cycle completes after what feels like centuries but might be hours. You've died and been reborn hundreds of times. You're utterly exhausted, profoundly transformed, completely different from the being who started this trial.\n\nThe Canvas Ghost bows deeply, showing respect for the first time. \"You have succeeded. Not by maintaining static existence as I expected, but by learning to die and resurrect at will. You've become something I never was, something I never imagined—a phoenix of the threshold.\"\n\n\"So I take your place?\" you gasp, still recovering from the final death-rebirth cycle.\n\n\"No. You've earned something far better. You've become your own kind of threshold being. Not a Ghost like me, but a Phoenix. You exist through transformation itself—dying into paint, resurrecting into flesh, endlessly cycling between states. I maintain the threshold through static presence. You maintain it through constant death and rebirth.\"\n\nYou spread your arms experimentally and feel yourself dissolve into pure threshold energy, then reconstitute in a burst of pigment and flesh. Again. And again. You can do it at will now, die and be reborn in seconds.\n\nYou are death and rebirth. You are the cycle itself. You are the Pigment Phoenix, and you will burn and rise forever.\n\n**Chapter 1: Complete**\n**Ending Unlocked: Pigment Phoenix**\n*You challenged the Canvas Ghost and survived through hundreds of deaths.

Not certain futures, but possible ones. You can touch a painted being and sense the memories they'll forget tomorrow, next year, in a century. You can see the paths they might walk by seeing what they'll lose along each path.\n\nYou become the Pigment Prophet—the one who sees through the medium of forgotten things, who reads time by its absences. Painted beings consult you before making major choices. \"What will I forget if I take this path?\" they ask, terrified and hopeful.\n\nYou show them honestly.
