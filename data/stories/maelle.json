The documents can't agree.\n\nYou are Maelle, and you remember things that haven't happened yet.\n\nThe latest manuscript sits before you, its ink still wet though the date reads two centuries ago. It speaks of a Writer named Alicia who discovered the truth behind the expeditions—that they're not journeys into space but into possibility itself.\n\nYour pen moves without conscious thought, adding notes to the margin.
