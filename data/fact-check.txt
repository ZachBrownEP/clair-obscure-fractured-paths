In the game Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Alicia becomes trapped in a painting and is reborn as a new persona named Maelle, who is blissfully ignorant of her past. As Maelle, she lives a full life, but eventually, her true memories resurface, leading to an identity crisis. In the end, the painted world is destroyed, causing Maelle to cease to exist and Alicia to be left behind with a lifetime of Maelle's memories, causing her to prefer her fictional life over her real, traumatized one. 
What happened to Alicia
Reborn as Maelle: After entering the painting, Alicia's persona is overwritten by her mother, and she is reborn as a new person named Maelle.
Experiencing a new life: Maelle lives an entire life within the painted world, unaware of her original identity.
Memories resurface: During the game, Alicia gets glimpses of her past life. At the end of Act 2, the painted world is destroyed, and Maelle is stripped away, leaving Alicia to retain both her original memories and Maelle's entire lifetime of memories.
Identity crisis and a choice: Alicia is now a disfigured and traumatized individual with the memories of Maelle's life. She chooses to embrace the life of Maelle because she prefers the happiness and experiences of that fictional world. 
The painted world and its destruction
The painted world is a fantasy created to help the family deal with their grief and trauma.
At the end of the game, the painted world is destroyed because it is causing damage to the real world. The destruction erases all the painted characters, including Maelle.
The destruction of the painted world is what brings Alicia back to reality and leads to her embracing the life of Maelle. 


In Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, the "expedition" fails and ultimately leads to the release of the real Aline Dessendre from her prison in the Monolith. During the final confrontation, Aline makes a return to the canvas and uses her powers as the Paintress to help the Expedition neutralize Renoir, thus forcing her way out of the monolith. 
Here's a breakdown of what happened: 
The initial plan: The Expedition's true purpose was to fail, which would have trapped the real Aline inside the canvas, leaving her vulnerable to being killed by Renoir/the Curator.
Aline's struggle: While trapped, Aline's powers dwindled as Renoir and Clea's "Nevrons" blocked the chroma of the expired Expeditioners from returning to her, so she painted a number on the monolith to warn of her weakening ability to protect Lumière's population.
The final twist: The expeditioners realize the real threat is the Curator (Renoir), who wants to erase the painting entirely. Aline, realizing the Curator is about to succeed, makes a final return to the canvas to stop him and aid the team in the final battle. 


Aline is the secondary antagonist of the game Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, also known as "The Paintress". She is the mother of the main character, Alicia, and a powerful magic user known as a Painter who can create entire worlds called "Canvases". The game's story centers on her, her deceased son Verso, and the aftermath of a fire that disfigured Alicia and killed Verso. 


Verso: Original identity: In the real world, Verso was the son of Renoir and Aline Dessendre and the brother of Alicia (who becomes Maelle) and Clea. He was a talented musician who created his own canvas world as a child.
Tragic death: Verso died tragically in a house fire while trying to save his sister Alicia.
Post-death identity: After his death, his mother created a copy of their family inside his canvas as a way to cope with her grief, which is the world the expedition now inhabits.

Maelle is in reality Alicia Dessendre, Renoir and Aline's daughter and Clea and Verso's younger sister. After Verso died saving Alicia in a house fire, their mother Aline, overwhelmed by grief, sought refuge in the Canvas, which contained the last piece of his soul. Here she created Painted copies of the family.
